User requirement: Perform a buoyant thermal convection simulation using buoyantFoam solver for Bernard cells formation. The domain is a rectangular channel with dimensions 9x1x2 units (convertToMeters=1). The mesh consists of 90x10x1 cells with uniform grading. Set floor temperature to 301K and ceiling temperature to 300K, with zero gradient temperature boundary conditions on sidewalls. Initial temperature field is uniform 300K. Use Boussinesq approximation for fluid properties with reference density rho0=1 kg/m³ at T0=300K and thermal expansion coefficient beta=1e-3 K⁻¹. Set fluid properties: kinematic viscosity=1e-3 m²/s, specific heat capacity Cv=712 J/kgK, and Prandtl number Pr=1. Apply no-slip conditions on all walls. Initial velocity field is (1e-4, 0, 0) m/s. Use PIMPLE algorithm with 2 correctors and no momentum predictor. Gravity acts in negative y-direction with g=-9.81 m/s². Run simulation from t=0 to t=1000s with deltaT=1s and write results every 50s. Use kEpsilon turbulence model with initial k=1e-5 m²/s² and epsilon=1e-5 m²/s³. The front and back faces are set as empty boundary conditions for 2D simulation. Include streamline calculation from point (0, 0.5, 0) to (9, 0.5, 0) with 24 points for flow visualization.
