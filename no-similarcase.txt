User requirement: do a counterflow flame simulation using OpenFOAM reactingFoam solver, employing a compressible flow solver for detailed combustion modeling. Define the computational domain as a 2D rectangular region with a width of 0.02 meters and a height of 0.02 meters. Use CH4, O2 and N2 as species. Include chemical kinetics using the reaction mechanism. velocity of fuel is 0.1 m/s and velocity of air is -0.1 m/s. Set the simulation runtime from 0 to 0.5 seconds with a write interval of 0.05 seconds and deltaT of 1e-6.
Please ensure that the generated file is complete, functional, and logically sound.Additionally, apply your domain expertise to verify that all numerical values are consistent with the user's requirements, maintaining accuracy and coherence.
