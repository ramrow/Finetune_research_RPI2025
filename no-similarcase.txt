Perform a 3D Bernard Cell simulation using OpenFOAM buoyantFoam solver. The computational domain spans 9 m x 1 m x 2 m. The simulation begins at t=0 seconds and runs until t=1000 seconds with a time step of 1 second, and results are written at intervals of every 50 seconds. One wall has a temperature of 301 K, while the other has a temperature of 300 K.
Please ensure that the generated file is complete, functional, and logically sound.Additionally, apply your domain expertise to verify that all numerical values are consistent with the user's requirements, maintaining accuracy and coherence.
