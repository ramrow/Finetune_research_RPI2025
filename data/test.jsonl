For phase properties, use water and vapor as working fluids with surface tension from liquid properties, and Sauer-Schnerr cavitation model (nucleation site density=1.6e13, nucleation site diameter=2e-6m, saturation pressure=2364 Pa).

The continuous phase is water (density=997 kg/m\u00b3, viscosity=3.645e-4 Pa\u00b7s, Cp=4195 J/kgK) and dispersed phases are two air groups (viscosity=1.84e-5 Pa\u00b7s, Cp=1007 J/kgK) with bubble diameters ranging from 1mm to 5mm (air1) and 6mm to 12mm (air2). Set initial water velocity to (0,0,1.6) m/s with k-omega-SST-Sato turbulence model. Apply mapped inlet condition for velocity, pressure outlet condition (p=1e5 Pa), and no-slip wall condition for water phase with slip conditions for air phases. Include lift (Tomiyama model), wall lubrication (Antal model), and turbulent dispersion (Burns model) forces. Implement bubble coalescence and breakup using Lehr-Millies-Mewes models. Set initial temperature to 300K for all phases. Run simulation from t=0s to t=4s with initial timestep of 1e-4s (adjustable with maxCo=0.8), writing results every 0.5s.

Boundary conditions include: mass flow inlet with constant rate of 0.1 kg/s and turbulent boundary layer profile, pressure outlet with fixed value, no-slip walls except for porous walls which have slip condition. For turbulence, use inlet turbulent intensity of 0.05 and mixing length of 0.005m, with wall functions for k (kqRWallFunction) and epsilon (epsilonWallFunction) at walls. The fluid properties are specified using perfectGas equation of state with molecular weight 28.9, specific heat capacity (Cp) of 1005 J/kgK, and dynamic viscosity of 1.82e-5 kg/m\u22c5s.
